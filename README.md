## 📊 Dataset Overview: `board2.xlsx` [ECE Board Exam]

The `board2.xlsx` dataset contains academic performance information  of 30 Electronics Engineer (ECE) board takers across multiple subjects. The data is structured as follows:

| Column Name    | Description                                                         |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name           | Identifier for each student (anonymized as S1, S2, etc.)            |
| Gender         | Gender of the student (Male/Female)                                 |
| Track          | The Electronics Engineering specialization track chosen by the student (e.g., Instrumentation, Communication) |
| Hometown       | The region where the student is from (Luzon, Visayas, Mindanao)      |
| Math           | Student's score in Mathematics                                      |
| Electronics    | Student's score in Electronics                                      |
| GEAS           | Student's score in General Engineering and Applied Sciences         |
| Communication  | Student's score in Communication skills                             |

### Sample Data:
| Name  | Gender | Track            | Hometown | Math | Electronics | GEAS | Communication |
|-------|--------|------------------|----------|------|-------------|------|---------------|
| S1    | Male   | Instrumentation   | Luzon    | 58   | 89          | 75   | 78            |
| S2    | Female | Communication     | Mindanao | 52   | 75          | 90   | 52            |
| S3    | Female | Instrumentation   | Mindanao | 83   | 74          | 77   | 57            |
| S4    | Male   | Instrumentation   | Visayas  | 65   | 58          | 91   | 68            |
| S5    | Male   | Communication     | Luzon    | 59   | 86          | 43   | 88            |

## 🌟 What You'll Learn

- Efficient **Data Wrangling** techniques using **Pandas**.
- Cleaning and transforming datasets to make them analysis-ready.
- Creating insightful **data visualizations** with **Matplotlib** that highlight trends and relationships.
- Practical hands-on experience with real-world datasets.

---

### 📊 Data Visualization

In the final part of the notebook, a **bar chart** visualizes the performance of board takers across different subjects, grouped by their Electronics Engineering specialization track. This visualization compares how board takers in different tracks perform in **Math**, **Electronics**, **GEAS**, and **Communication**.

#### Graph Explanation:

- The **x-axis** represents the different subjects: Math, Electronics, GEAS, and Communication.
- The **y-axis** represents the scores obtained by the students in each subject.
- The data is grouped by **Track** (Instrumentation and Communication), allowing a comparison of average scores between takers pursuing different Electronics Engineering specialization tracks.

This graph helps identify any trends or patterns in academic performance based on the examiners' track.
